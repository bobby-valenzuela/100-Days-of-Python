# Python Challenges and Exercises

My first go at Python - following along from Angels Yu's Udemy course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022"
as well as Colt Steel's "Modern Python 3 Bootcamp" and Jose Portilla's 2022 Complete Python Bootcamp.

Adding comments on what I've learned to do/do better as I go along
